                <p>What are we, if nothing but the sum of our experiences? I feel like I have led a fairly interesting life; always willing to try the new, be uncomfortable, take a chance. My experiences range from working on a sport fishing boat in Alaska to owning a private tutoring business in South Korea. </p>
                <p>Not knowing what to study, I thought business administration was proabably a reasonable field. I majored in Finance, but in my third year, my artistic itch had to be scratched, so I took 2 quarters of art classes to re-evaluate. It was fun, but ultimately decided that a business degree would serve me better than one in art.</p>
                <p>After gratduating from the University of Oregon in '94', I immediately eschewed the idea of a "real" job and got a job bartending on a cruiseship. Always looking for the next thing to keep my interest, I then moved on to restaurant managment  and then to merchant processing.</p>
                <p>My life changed one day when I read an advertisement to teach ESL in South Korea. I interviewed and three weeks later I landed at Gimpo Int'l Airport. ot called back on the way home from the interview to be told I had the job</p>
                <p>I have spent the last twentyone years building a successful life and small education business in Korea. That's a long time in one place, doing the same thing.</p> 
                <p>I decided that this point in my life would be as good as any to try something new; to reinvent myself, so we loaded up the truck and we moved to... The USA.</p>
                <p>Planning to do things I just didn't have time to do while running a business, the first step in this life evolution life has taken me down a road less, nay, never, travelled by me before; coding!</p>
